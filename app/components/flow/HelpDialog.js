    <Typography variant="display1">What are voting credits?</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      Voting Credits are used to purchase votes. The amount of voting credits equals the amount of {props.symbol} you
      had in the wallet address used to open the Voting Dapp when the poll was created.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="display1">Why do I have zero voting credits?</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      You have zero voting credits because the wallet used to open the voting dapp had zero {props.symbol} in it at the
      time the poll was created.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="display1">Why do votes cost more voting credits for every additional vote?</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      The price of votes equals its square in voting credits. This means purchasing the first vote on a ballot costs 1
      voting credit, the second vote will require a total of 4 voting credits, the third vote will cost 9 voting credits
      in total.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">This is done to prevent domination of the vote by large token holders.</Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1">
      You may connect with a Ledger or Tezors via the metamask intergration. Information for how to connect to Trezor

    <Typography variant="display1">Why do I need to pay ETH to vote?</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      Voting is done "on-chain", this means that your vote is written to the ethereum blockchain, ensuring that your
      vote is transparent and immutable. To write any data to the ethereum blockchain requires miners to validate the
      transaction. Miner's require an incentive in the form of ETH to mine a transaction.
